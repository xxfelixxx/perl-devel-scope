=head1 NAME

Devel::Scope - Scope based debug

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.04

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Provide a debug method that outputs conditionally based on the scoping level.

    use Devel::Scope qw( debug );

    debug("main"); # Main Scope

    sub foo {
        debug("inside foo"); # Function Scope
        if ( 1 ) {
            debug("if true start calculations"); # Function Scope + 1
            for my $x ( 0..3 ) {
                debug("x is set to $x"); # Function Scope + 2
                for my $y ( 0..3 ) {
                    debug("x=$x, y=$y"); # Function Scope + 3
                    for my $z ( 0 ..3 ) {
                        debug("x=$x, y=$y, z=$z"); # Function Scope + 4
                    }
                }
            }
            debug("end of calculaions");
        }
        debug("leaving foo");
    }

    ...

    DEVEL_SCOPE_DEPTH=3 perl foo.pl

=head1 EXPORT

    debug

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 debug

    Prints only when the scope is greater (deeper) than some number.
    Turns into a NO-OP unless DEVEL_SCOPE environmental variable is set.
